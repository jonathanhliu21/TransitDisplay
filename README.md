![IMG_8817](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a6341b2-ae9e-49e4-8904-a7b413a11a9c)

This project involves a self-contained display which shows upcoming transit departures. The display can be used in coffee shops, office lobbies, or hotel lobbies to serve as transit information for travelers or commuters, allowing them to plan their travel or commute more conveniently without having to navigate through complex transit apps. 

The README is a WIP as I finalize the project; please check back mid-Sep 2025 for a full project description.
